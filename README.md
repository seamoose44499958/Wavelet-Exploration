**# Wavelet Exploration
#### My exploration into Wavelets and the Continuous Wavelet Transform!

## Motivation 
  The goal of this github repo is to give a very basic brief summary of all I learned about wavelets. I will mainly 
  be focusing on the **1D CWT** (Continuous Wavelet Transform) transform, but will still talk about the subject of wavelets 	as a whole.
  Hopefully this provides a good spring board to diving deeper into the subject. 
  Feel free to point out any mistakes I made in the [Issues]("https://github.com/seamoose44499958/Wavelet-Exploration/issues").
  

## Outline
.I will first start of by comparing the **CWT** (Continuous Wavelet Transform) to other transforms such as the **DWT** (Discrete Wavelet), **DFT**(Discrete Fourier Transform) and the **STFT** (Short-time Fourier transform). This part is intended to make clear if your application requires the use of CWT. Moving on I will talk about wavelets and some of their properties. The goal of this part is for you to get a weak grasp of how to choose the best wavelet for your application. Lastly, I will talk about my initial application of them
which is the stock market! All the code examples are written in **Python** and use the **Matplotlib**, **Pywavelet**, and **Numpy** libraries.
